# Track Down Bill
## Own side project to help myself and my family with bills

### **_Introduction_**
The story is that we are renovating our home in the last 2 years and does not seem to end (yet..). *What is the worst in renovation projects?*

No, not just the continues surprises behind the walls, or the crappy electricity system or the weird sewage pipe connection... But the bills... 

Buying materials in shop or online and not really able to track the money... So my idea is to build an app, which is user friendly and can save time and trouble with bills.

It is going to be a CRUD app with database connection. 

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. React front end hopefully
2. Node Js / Express JS
3. MongoDB

**Aim of the Project**

Of course to help to track the bills, but it is also a practice project to get more hands-on experience with NodeJS. I really liked to build back end during the **SpaceRock** project and I would like to continue to expand my back end (Node JS) knowledge. 

Other big mission is to build this with React framework, what I am currently learning. 

**Challenges within the Project**

COMING SOON.

## **_What have I learned_**
COMING SOON (but hopefully tons of React and good practice of NodeJS)

## Deployed: in the future
