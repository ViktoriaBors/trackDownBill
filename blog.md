# Track Down Bill - blog
## Own side project to help myself and my family with bills

**Day 1 - 3**
Setting up the backend first.

That was a really interesting way to start the project. Why? Normally I would start with front end and some design ideas. BUT the project is going to be used with some JS framework (probably VUE.js), what I am just learning up right now. So I decided to try to set up the NodeJs back end instead. It was challenging without knowing 100% what data is going to come to back end. Of course I have some ideas how the data should look like and I expect that it is going to be the same. But there is this little what if... I cannot achieve the same structure. Anyway I set up the back end and tested through POSTMAN application.

**Day 4**
Design ideas

I started to think about the design and hard-coded to the html. I tried to make the design thinking in COMPONENTS, what I can use later for the framework to set up templates.
